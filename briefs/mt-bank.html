  execSummary: `M&T Bank (NYSE: MTB) is a $2.48B regional banking powerhouse operating 1,000+ branches across the Eastern U.S. SEC filings confirm active cloud migration with dual CIO leadership (Michael Wisler as CIO plus technology operations leadership). The bank's complex multi-cloud environment — driven by both organic growth and the 2022 People's United Bank acquisition — creates significant FinOps optimization opportunity. Combined with legacy infrastructure from the merger integration, M&T Bank represents a $1.2M ARR opportunity spanning FinOps, managed cloud, security, and compliance.`,
