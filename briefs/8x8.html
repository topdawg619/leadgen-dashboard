  execSummary: `8x8, Inc. (NASDAQ: EGHT) is a $185M cloud communications and customer experience platform provider. Despite being a cloud-native company for its products, SEC filings reveal significant legacy on-premises infrastructure supporting internal operations and legacy platform components. Two separate filings reference infrastructure modernization and cloud transition, indicating an active hardware refresh cycle. This represents a classic DaaS + IaaS migration play — helping a cloud company move its own internal infrastructure to the cloud.`,

    {title: 'Legacy Infrastructure Despite Cloud Products', detail: '8x8 sells cloud communications but still runs internal operations on legacy on-premises infrastructure. SEC filings reference infrastructure modernization and cloud transition — a textbook "cobbler\'s children" scenario where a cloud company needs help migrating its own systems.'},
    {title: 'Dual SEC Filing Signals', detail: 'Two separate SEC filings flag cloud migration and legacy infrastructure concerns. Multiple filings = sustained initiative, not a one-time mention. This indicates ongoing budget allocation.'},
    {title: 'Hardware Refresh Window', detail: 'On-prem infrastructure references suggest aging hardware approaching end-of-life. Hardware refresh cycles are the single highest-conversion trigger for IaaS and DaaS adoption — the business case writes itself (CapEx → OpEx).'},
    {title: 'UCaaS Industry Knowledge', detail: '8x8 understands cloud economics intimately from their product side. They will appreciate a sophisticated managed cloud proposal that speaks their language — SLAs, uptime guarantees, and TCO modeling.'},
    {title: 'Mid-Market Sweet Spot', detail: 'At $185M revenue and ~2,300 employees, 8x8 is in RapidScale\'s sweet spot — large enough for meaningful ARR, small enough that a managed provider is more cost-effective than building a full internal cloud ops team.'}

  whyCRO: '8x8 is a public company with a $320K ARR opportunity that requires navigating both technical and financial stakeholders. The "cloud company that needs cloud help" narrative requires careful positioning at the executive level.',
  croReasons: [
    'Sensitive messaging: Telling a cloud company they need cloud help requires executive-level finesse and positioning.',
    'CFO engagement critical: The CapEx → OpEx narrative is the primary business case driver — requires CRO coordination with finance.',
    'Competitive risk: 8x8 has deep cloud vendor relationships (AWS, Azure) and could attempt self-managed migration. CRO-level value proposition differentiation is essential.',
    'Reference account potential: A UCaaS company choosing RapidScale for its own infrastructure is a powerful "even cloud companies trust us" case study.',
    'Timing sensitivity: Hardware refresh windows are finite — CRO must ensure sales velocity matches the decision timeline.'
