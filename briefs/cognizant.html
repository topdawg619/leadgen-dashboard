  execSummary: `Cognizant (NASDAQ: CTSH) is a $21.1B global IT services and consulting company with deep vertical expertise in healthcare and financial services. SEC filings reference digital transformation in the context of their own internal infrastructure modernization — distinct from the transformation services they sell to clients. With healthcare being their largest vertical and HIPAA/HITRUST compliance requirements intensifying, Cognizant represents a high-value managed cloud and compliance opportunity. Their scale (350,000+ employees) means even targeted infrastructure services generate significant ARR.`,

  whyHighValue: [
    {title: 'Healthcare Vertical Dominance', detail: 'Healthcare is Cognizant\'s largest revenue segment. They manage IT infrastructure for hospitals, payers, and life sciences companies — creating a direct need for HIPAA-compliant managed infrastructure to support their own operations and client delivery environments.'},
    {title: 'SEC Filing Transformation Signals', detail: 'Recent SEC filings reference digital transformation of internal operations. This is notable because Cognizant sells transformation — when they invest in their own modernization, it signals significant internal infrastructure gaps.'},
    {title: 'Scale Creates ARR Opportunity', detail: 'At 350,000+ employees and global operations, even a targeted managed infrastructure engagement (development environments, internal tools, compliance systems) generates substantial recurring revenue.'},
    {title: 'AI-First Pivot Creating Infrastructure Demand', detail: 'Cognizant is rebuilding its tech stack for AI-first delivery. This pivot requires significant new cloud infrastructure for AI/ML workloads, training environments, and GPU compute — all areas where managed cloud providers add value.'},
    {title: 'Client Environment Hosting', detail: 'Cognizant hosts development and staging environments for healthcare and financial clients. These environments have strict compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC2, HITRUST) that managed security and compliance services directly address.'}

  whyCRO: 'Cognizant is a $21B company — engaging them requires CRO-level strategic alignment and the ability to navigate complex enterprise procurement.',
  croReasons: [
    'Enterprise scale: $950K ARR in a Fortune 200 company requires senior executive sponsorship and dedicated pursuit resources.',
    'Strategic partnership positioning: Cognizant doesn\'t buy "vendor services" — they partner. CRO must frame RapidScale as a strategic infrastructure partner.',
    'Healthcare compliance complexity: HIPAA, HITRUST, and SOC2 requirements across client environments demand executive-level compliance assurance.',
    'Competitive displacement: At this scale, Cognizant has existing hyperscaler relationships (AWS, Azure, GCP). RapidScale must position differentiated managed services value.',
    'Multi-geography implications: With global operations, initial US engagement could expand to international managed services — CRO must plan for multi-phase growth.'
