  execSummary: `Scripps Health is a $3.5B non-profit integrated health system and one of San Diego's two dominant healthcare providers. They operate 5 hospital campuses, 30+ outpatient facilities, and employ ~15,000 staff. Critically, Scripps suffered a devastating $112.7 million ransomware attack in May 2021 that took all systems offline for nearly a month and compromised 1 million+ patient records. This institutional trauma — combined with their CIO being on Becker's "CIOs to Know 2025" list and an active EHR system replacement — creates an exceptionally qualified opportunity. Every IT decision at Scripps is filtered through the lens of "never again."`,

    {title: 'The $112.7 Million Ransomware Lesson', detail: 'In May 2021, Scripps suffered a catastrophic ransomware attack: all IT systems offline, paper records for a month, emergency patients diverted, 1M+ patient records compromised, $91.6M in lost revenue plus $21.1M in recovery costs. This isn\'t a theoretical risk conversation — Scripps lived it. Every infrastructure investment is now evaluated against "would this have prevented May 2021?"'},
    {title: 'Active EHR System Replacement', detail: 'Scripps is replacing their ambulatory and inpatient EHR and revenue cycle management systems. Major EHR migrations require bulletproof DR, managed security, and compliance infrastructure — this is a once-in-a-decade buying window.'},

  whyCRO: 'Scripps Health is a $3.5B health system in our home market that suffered a $112.7M ransomware attack. The combination of institutional trauma, active EHR migration, and local proximity makes this a must-win account that requires maximum CRO attention.',
  croReasons: [
    'Must-win local account: Scripps is in San Diego — RapidScale\'s home market. Losing this to a competitor would be a visible local defeat.',
    'Institutional trauma creates urgency: Post-ransomware buying psychology means security and DR budgets have executive protection. This is a funded initiative.',
    'EHR migration window: The EHR replacement creates a time-limited buying opportunity for supporting infrastructure. Missing this window means waiting 5-10 years.',
    'Deal complexity: $850K ARR across security, compliance, managed cloud, and DR requires multi-service solution architecture and executive coordination.',
    'Reference account significance: Winning one of San Diego\'s two dominant health systems creates a definitive local healthcare reference.',
    'Competitive intensity: Healthcare IT vendors are aggressively pursuing post-ransomware Scripps. CRO must ensure RapidScale is in the consideration set early.'

  hook: '"Shane, what Scripps went through in May 2021 changed how every health system in America thinks about infrastructure resilience. As you\'re now replacing your EHR — the most critical system in the building — I want to make sure the infrastructure underneath it is built so that never happens again. We\'re local, we\'re specialized in healthcare, and we\'d love 30 minutes to show you what \'never again\' looks like architecturally."'
