  execSummary: `Freddie Mac is a $22B+ government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) that purchases, guarantees, and securitizes home mortgages — making it one of the most critical financial infrastructure entities in the United States. SEC filings reveal active digital transformation and legacy infrastructure migration signals. With a dedicated CIO (Frank Nazzaro) driving modernization, regulatory requirements from FHFA, and legacy systems supporting $3.5 trillion in mortgage securities, Freddie Mac represents the single largest revenue opportunity in the current pipeline. The combination of IaaS, DaaS, managed security, and compliance management creates a $1.8M ARR multi-service engagement.`,

    'National significance: Freddie Mac is systemically important financial infrastructure. Security or continuity failures have national economic implications.',
    'Procurement complexity: GSE procurement involves structured RFP processes, compliance documentation, and multi-stakeholder approval chains. CRO must coordinate cross-functional resources.',

    'Reference account value: Winning Freddie Mac would be the most significant reference in RapidScale\'s portfolio — transformative for the financial services vertical.',
    'Multi-year engagement: Infrastructure modernization of this scale is a 3-5 year relationship. CRO must ensure contract structure supports long-term partnership economics.'
