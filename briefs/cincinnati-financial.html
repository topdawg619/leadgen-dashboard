  execSummary: `Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ: CINF) is a $3.09B property-casualty insurance holding company with a 75+ year operating history. SEC filings signal digital transformation and disaster recovery modernization — critical for an insurer that both underwrites cyber risk and must protect its own infrastructure. With a Hall of Fame CIO leading transformation and 2026 cyber insurance regulations requiring tabletop exercise documentation, Cincinnati Financial represents a dual-play opportunity: DRaaS for business continuity and IR Readiness as a direct product alignment with their underwriting business.`,
